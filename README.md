quick demo hack for a database as a service based on docker

Flask based application for creating instances of a database. Not very fancy just a demo of 5 minutes hack.

Remeber to install dependencies:

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Start the application by calling:

   `python app.py`
   
Check if it works:

   `curl -X GET -v localhost:8081`
